# mouse-bed

Add a place where your cursor can chill when you're chilling.

## Description

I'm always looking for useless alignments between my cursor and elements on the page. So, I made this in order to hide
my cursor when I want to. Thanks to this addon, I can now chill about my mouse and stress out about other dumb things.

## Installation

[Chrome documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world?hl=en#load-unpacked)

Maybe I'll publish it on the Chrome Web Store one day.
